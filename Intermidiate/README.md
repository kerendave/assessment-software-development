# Intermediate Track

Welcome to the **Intermediate Track** of the Software Development Unit (SDU).

This folder contains all resources, projects, and submissions related to the Intermediate learning track. Members in this track are expected to demonstrate deeper technical understanding, structured development practices, and effective use of prompt engineering with real tech stacks.

---

## Objective

The goal of the Intermediate Track is to help members:
- Apply prompt engineering to real development workflows
- Build functional, scalable applications
- Work confidently with frontend and/or backend technologies
- Follow professional GitHub and collaboration practices

---

## What You Should Do

As an Intermediate Track participant, you are expected to:

1. Review advanced prompt engineering materials
2. Choose and work with a specific tech stack
3. Build at least **one complete intermediate-level project**
4. Integrate AI tools (e.g., Lovable) responsibly into your workflow
5. Properly document development decisions and architecture
6. Push all work to this repository following the structure below
---

## Folder Structure

Your work inside the `intermediate` folder should follow this structure:

```bash
intermediate/
│
├── projects/
│ ├── project-name/
│ │ ├── src/ # Application source code
│ │ ├── README.md # Project overview & setup
│ │ ├── config/ # Config files (if applicable)
│ │ └── tests/ # Tests (optional but encouraged)
│
├── prompts/
│ └── prompts.md # Prompts used with explanations
│
├── documentation/
│ ├── architecture.md # System design & decisions
│ └── learning-notes.md # Lessons learned & challenges
│
└── README.md # This file

```

## What to Put Inside

### `projects/`
- One or more intermediate-level projects
- Each project must include a `README.md` with:
  - Project description
  - Tech stack used
  - Setup and run instructions
  - Key features

### `prompts/`
- Prompts used during:
  - Planning
  - Coding
  - Debugging
  - Optimization
- Include short explanations of prompt intent and results

### `documentation/`
- **Architecture decisions**
- Development challenges and solutions
- Trade-offs made during implementation

---

## Project Guidelines

Projects should:
- Use a defined tech stack (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Django)
- Integrate AI tools such as **Lovable** where appropriate
- Go beyond static websites
- Demonstrate real functionality (APIs, databases, auth, etc.)

---

## Work Ethics & Guidelines

- Write maintainable, modular code
- Use GitHub branches and pull requests properly
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Avoid blindly copying AI-generated code
- Be able to explain every part of your implementation

---

## Completion Criteria

You have successfully completed the Intermediate Track when:
- At least one fully working project is submitted
- Codebase is well-structured and documented
- Prompts and architectural decisions are documented
- Application runs without critical errors

---

## Next Steps

Once approved, you may progress to the **Advanced Track**, where real-world impact and production-ready applications are expected.

Build smart. Build responsibly 🚀
