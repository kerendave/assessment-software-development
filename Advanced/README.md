# Advanced Track

Welcome to the **Advanced Track** of the Software Development Unit (SDU).

This folder contains all resources, projects, and submissions related to the Advanced learning track. Members in this track are expected to demonstrate production-level software development skills, real-world impact, and strong engineering discipline.

---

## Objective

The goal of the Advanced Track is to:
- Showcase real-world, production-ready applications
- Demonstrate advanced system design and scalability
- Apply professional development and deployment practices
- Mentor and support other SDU members where possible

---

## What You Should Do

As an Advanced Track participant, you are expected to:

1. Submit an application that is actively used in the real world
2. Demonstrate ownership of the full development lifecycle
3. Maintain high-quality code and documentation standards
4. Show evidence of real users, usage, or deployment
5. Clearly explain architectural and technical decisions
6. Push all work to this repository following the structure below

---

## Folder Structure

  - Problem statement
  - Solution overview
  - Tech stack
  - Deployment process
  - Usage instructions

### `prompts/`
- Advanced prompt workflows used for:
  - System design
  - Debugging and optimization
  - Refactoring and performance tuning
- Explain how AI tools improved efficiency or quality

### `documentation/`
- System architecture diagrams and explanations
- Key technical decisions and justifications
- Scaling, performance, and security considerations
- Lessons learned from real-world usage
